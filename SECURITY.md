## **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take the security of our projects seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability,
we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please DO NOT open a public JIRA/GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report the vulnerability directly as described at
the [Security Contacts and Procedures](https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact/#contact).

### **Supported Versions**

We provide security fixes for the **latest stable release** of each project.
To find out which versions match this criteria go to the corresponding project page on [our website](https://hibernate.org/). For example:

* [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/)
* [Hibernate Search](https://hibernate.org/search/releases/)
* [Hibernate Validator](https://hibernate.org/validator/releases/)
* [Hibernate Reactive](https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/)

We recommend you use the most recent version to ensure you have the latest security patches and bug fixes.
